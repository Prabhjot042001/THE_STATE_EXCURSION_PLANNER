# THE_STATE_EXCURSION_PLANNER
The State Excursion Planner is a course streamlining agent that targets reducing the travel time and cost of the client by demonstrating the most brief course and in this manner enhancing their experience. The objective is to track down the briefest way covering all places the traveler has decided to visit. The course is given by remembering the beginning stage of the excursion. Here, the beginning and the end points of the excursion are something similar. The idea is to implement Nearest Neighbor algorithm (NN) and improve the results using Dynamic Programming (DP).
